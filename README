In order to compile this package:

// first do the standard automake sequence
aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a

// then create an object directory where you compile the program
mkdir obj
cd obj

// then configure with C++11 standard (-std=c++11 for gcc 4.7, -std=c++0x for gcc 4.6 and below;
// most likely very old compilers won't work).

// Also, we need to and an appropriate flag to link
// "-lboost_regex -lblas -llapack"
// Blame libstdc++ that does not have complete regex yet.

// Use any options as you like.
// Note that -O3 optimization is fine, but it will take a lot till it compiles everything.

../configure 'CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11' 'LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib'

// move to the directory where an executable is located
cd src

// the name is still PolyR12 (it used to be a periodic R12/F12 code long ago.)
ln -s ../../src/basis basis

// make
make -j4

// This step takes a lot (since it compiles something like F12 integrals, derivative integrals, ...)
// it often fails to link at the very end. Let me know if you see it with an error message.

// run
./PolyR12 ../../src/benzene_mp2_svp.in
