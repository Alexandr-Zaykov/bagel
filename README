*** Disclaimer ***

  This is a public pre-alpha version and may have serious bugs.
  If you find problems that persist for an extended period of time,
  please open an issue or make a pull request with a patch.
  The BAGEL developers are trying their best, but are not commited to fix
  all the reported bugs in a timely manner due to time constraints.

  Developers are likely to have newer code in their private branches.
  If you want to gain access to a program that implements a published work and
  you do not find it in the public repository, please write to the authors.

  BAGEL is intended for use in parallel environments with a few Terabyte
  of distributed memory (e.g., hence there is no disk interface).
  We are NOT going to optimize BAGEL for a stand-alone workstation.
