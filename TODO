o Currently FCI is limited to singlet, due to the fact that there is no effective way to compute an inintial guess CI vector. 

o Restart capability

o DF-Fock builder
   - Compress DF data storage
   - Screening of the first half transformation

o DF-CASSCF solver (Q matrix to be replaced).

o (ii|ii) = (ii|D)(J-1_DE(E|ii))s + ((ii|D)J-1_DE)s(E|ii) - ((ii|D)J-1_DE)s J_DE (J-1_EF(F|ii))s

o Coefficient should be kept (and not referenced from ref_!!)

o FCI can be faster if one uses Olsen's algorithm

o Quasi Newton updte for CASSCF

o For some reasons, cartesian basis is broken

o int size
