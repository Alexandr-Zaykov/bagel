o Restart capability

o DF-Fock builder
   - Compress DF data storage
   - Screening of the first half transformation

//o (ii|ii) = (ii|D)(J-1_DE(E|ii))s + ((ii|D)J-1_DE)s(E|ii) - ((ii|D)J-1_DE)s J_DE (J-1_EF(F|ii))s

o Quasi Newton updte for CASSCF

o int size

o perhaps the problem of WK CASSCF is the lack of orb-CI couplings. But then how can I do that?

o when input areas are empty, methods are not called 

o Stack size is hardwired now

o F12 DF factory is disabled now (see "#define SlaterFit DFDist" in src/df/fit.h). It is easy to make it again, though. 

o MP2 can be improved significantly 

o Make sure that MoldenIO is MPI-safe.

o FCI is not parallelized yet 

o Shell distribution to MPI processes (src/df/df.cc) should be optimized

o Matrix diagonalization and linear solver should be parallelized
